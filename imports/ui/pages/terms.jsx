      Welcome to All For One. By using this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by All For One, you’re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the “Terms”). <br/><br/>
We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email. New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively — we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you keep using All For One after a change, that means you accept the new terms.

<br/><br/>All For One is for your personal, non-commercial use.

      Usage of All For One

    <div style={styles.text}>
      You can browse All For One without registering for an account. You can read the different pledges people are making, and you can read the conversations in the general chat area. But to use some of our functions, you’ll need to register by signing in with Facebook. We require Facebook for 2 reasons: 1) because it proves you are a real person and 2) because we think sharing pledges in vitally important if they are to make a real difference to the world, and Facebook is the best way to do this.

      Suitable Pledges
    </Subheader>

    <div>
      All For One has some rules and guidelines around what makes a suitable pledge. In general, pledges are supposed to be focused on something that requires mass-participation in order to impact a much larger issue. Pledges of the following types are offered as suggestions for a pledge submission:
<br/><br/>•	A pledge designed to combat climate change by reducing carbon emissions
<br/>•	A pledge designed to reduce other types of environmental pollution e.g. reducing PM2.5 emissions or reducing plastic waste
<br/>•	A pledge designed to help solve social issues, such as boycotting products made with child labour, conflict minerals or materials whose production causes environmental destruction
<br/><br/>All For One is a site designed to solve big social problems, not to help you become a ‘better individual’. Pledges to this are end will be deemed as unsuitable. Pledges that are unsuitable are likely to be moderated and potentially removed from the site. An example of legal but ‘unsuitable’ pledges are given below as guidelines on what to avoid:
<br/><br/>•	A pledge to exercise more
<br/>•	A pledge to wake up earlier and work harder
<br/>•	A pledge to read more
<br/>•	A pledge to pick up a new hobby
<br/>
While these are obviously good things to do, if the focus is only improving yourself, this site is not suitable.
Pledges that are contrary to the terms below, for example if they are illegal or are some kind of personal attack, will be removed and the user may be banned from using the site.

•	You won’t submit stuff you don’t hold the copyright for (unless you have permission). Your Content will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material, or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material (and to grant All For One all the license rights outlined here).
•	Any royalties or licensing on your Content are your responsibility. You will pay all royalties and other amounts owed to any person or entity based on your Content, or on Kickstarter’s hosting of that Content.
